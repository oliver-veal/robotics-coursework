Welcome to DE3 Robotics Group 1 Coursework Documentation
========================================================

We are the **BROBOTICISTS**.
We have decided to create a readthedocs page for our coursework submissions instead of a Google Drive or Word document. This way this documentation can be used for teaching ROS at any point in the future, as well as have integrated code blocks and interactive videos.
For the purpose of archiving the document, we will be submitting in PDF and HTML formats.

.. warning::

    For a more interactive experience, please use the web_ version instead of the PDF. Thanks!

Setup
=====

Open Terminator to input commands and run different services or files.

Start by entering ``roscore`` - this is required to launch nodes and programs for the roscore system to start. It must be running in order for ROS nodes to communicate.

To start gazebo, in a new terminal, use ``rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo``, which generates an empty world.

- To close this instance use ``Ctrl+c``. 
- To close the Gazebo properly, in case multiple instances are running and it does not close, run ``killall gzserver gzclient``. The following response should occur if it has closed, ``gzserver: no process found`` and ``gzclient: no process found``.

Now it is possible to add the robotic arm to the simulation. In a new terminal run:

- ``cd Desktop/DE3Robotics``
- ``source devel/setup.bash``
- ``roslaunch coursework_1 coursework_1.launch``

The robotic arm should now be in Gazebo

.. note::
   Open Terminator to input commands to run different services or files
   
   Top Tip! The shortcut for opening new terminal instances:

   - ‘Ctrl+Shift+o’ - split horizontally
   - ‘Ctrl+Shift+e’ - split vertically

Forward Kinematics

Task A: Computing the D-H Table
-------------------------------

This task initialises the Denavit-Hartenberg, D-H, table.
The table contains all the necessary information to orientate each link of the robot in a consistent manner so that the position of each link can be found relative to the other.
As the robot moves, the D-H table is updated.
The D-H table is a convenient way to store this information as the transformation matrix for each link can be evaluated using the corresponding row in the table.

Derivation
----------------------------

To make the D-H table, the reference frames for each joint and for the end-effector must first be made and assigned origins and orientations. This is done according to the Denavit-Hartenberg convention. The steps for doing so with this particular robot are detailed below:

   1. Origin of *frame 0* was set at *joint 1*
   2. |z0| was set arbitrarily for simplicity pointing upwards towards *joint 2*
   3. Origin of *frame 1* was set at the intersection of the joint axes of *joint 1* and *joint 2*, so in the middle of the *joint 2*
   4. |z1| was set in the direction of the joint axis of *joint 1* and with the positive direction defined by the positive direction of rotation of *joint 1* (using the right-hand rule), so directly upwards
   5. Origin of *frame 2* was set at the same place as the origin of *frame 1*
   6. |z2| was set in the direction of the joint axis of *joint 2* and with the positive direction defined by the positive direction of rotation of *joint 2*
   7. Since |z1| and |z2| intersect, |x1| was set as the normal to the plane containing |z1| and |z2|, pointing towards *joint 3*
   8. For simplicity, |x0| was arbitrarily set as parallel and pointing in the same direction as |x1| in the starting position
   9. Origin of *frame 3* was set at the intersection of the joint axis of *joint 3* and the common perpendicular of the joint axes of *joint 2* and *joint 3* along |l1|, so in the centre of *joint 3*
   10. |z3| was set in the direction of the joint axis of *joint 3* and with the positive direction defined by the positive direction of rotation of *joint 3*
   11. |x2| was set as pointing along the common perpendicular of |z2| and |z3| along |l1|, pointing at *joint 3* 
   12. Origin of *frame 4* was set at the centre of the end effector
   13. For simplicity, |z4| was arbitrarily set to be parallel to and in the same direction as |z3|
   14. |x3| was set as pointing along the common perpendicular of |z3| and |z4| towards the origin of *frame 4*
   15. For simplicity, |x4| was arbitrarily set as parallel to and in the same direction as |x3|
   16. All *y* axes were set according to the right-hand coordinate system convention, completing the setup.

The result of this setup is shown below:

   :alt: Robot Diagram

*Fig 1: Diagram of robot with D-H conventional reference axes*

Using this diagram, the Denavit-Hartenberg table was made according to the following definitions:

   1. |ai| = the distance from |zi-1| to |zi| measured along |xi-1|
   2. |αi| = the angle between |zi-1| and |zi| measured about |xi-1|
   3. |di| = the distance from |xi-1| to |xi| measured along |zi|
   4. |θi| = the angle between |xi-1| and |xi| measured about |zi|

The resulting table is shown below:

*Table 1: D-H Table based on derivation*

|Link |  d  |  θ  |  a  |  α  |

|**3**|  0  ||θ3| ||l1| |  0  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|**4**|  0  |  0  ||l2| |  0  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

The numpy array, ``self.DH_tab``, line 13, is the live D-H table for the robot.
Its initial state is entered, with link lengths stored in ``self.links[n]``, where ``n`` is link number.
This refers to a list ``self.links`` created in line 8. The list is based on the ``link_lengths`` variable which is passed into the constructor.
This ``__init__`` function is the constructor of the ``RobotKineClass()`` class, meaning it is called when an instance of the class is initialised.
The list of link lengths is passed in as the only parameter when the ``RobotKineClass()`` is called.

.. warning::

   Line numbers in the following code blocks do not correspond to the line numbers in ``kinematics.py`` or any other script mentioned, only within the blocks.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

    class RobotKineClass():

    def __init__(self,link_lengths):

        self.ROSPublishers = set_joint_publisher()

        self.nj = 3
        self.links = link_lengths

        ################################################ TASK 1
        #Define DH table for each link. DH_tab in R^njx4
        #d,theta,a,alpha
        self.DH_tab = np.array([0., 0., 0., 0.],
                                [0., 0., 0., 0.],
                                [0., 0., 0., 0.],
                                [0., 0., 0., 0.]])
        self.joint_types = 'rrr'	# three revolute joints

The function ``getFK(self,q)`` accesses the ``DH_tab`` a row at a time and copies the i\ :sup:`th` row to ``DH_params`` to compute the transformation matrix from one frame to the next.
A list ``q`` of current joint angles (|θ|) is passed in, and added to the base-state ``DH_params``, in order to compute the current transformation matrix.
This is how the DH table is “updated” with changing |θ|.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   def getFK(self,q):

   T_0_i_1 = np.identity(4)
   for i in range(self.nj):

      DH_params = np.copy(self.DH_tab[i,:])     # DH values are deep copied so that the original values stored in the self.DH_tab variable are never modified.
      #print('q',q)
      #print(DH_params)
      if self.joint_types[i] == 'r':
            DH_params[1] = DH_params[1]+q[i]    # Current joint angle value added to "home" angle to get the current theta value.
      elif self.joint_types[i] == 'p':
            DH_params[0] = DH_params[0]+q[i]    # If the joint is prismatic, update the d value instead (the joint slides instead of rotating).

Therefore, since |θ| in the D-H table is updated by iteration at each step rather than updating a variable, |θ1|, |θ2|, and |θ3| are set to 0.
This is because the base configuration of the robot is such that the i\ :sup:`th` joints are in line with each other which results in the angles being set to 0.
These results are entered into the D-H table defined in the code.

   Our edits and additions to the code are highlighted in the following code blocks.

----------------------------
Task B: Coding the D-H Table
----------------------------

The numpy array, ``DH_matrix``, line 8, represents the transformation matrix from frame i-1 to frame i.
As such, the transformation matrices of each joint can be multiplied in a chain to transform coordinates from the end effector frame to the base frame.
This is taken care of in the next section, this function ``DH_matrix()`` only creates the i-1 to i matrix by copying in the relevant lines of the D-H table.
The definition for this is shown and derived below.

----------------------------------------

*Fig 2: Screw theory illustration*

Because the frames of reference were set up according to Denavit-Hartenberg convention, and the positive directions of axes were set according to the right-hand rule, or “screw” convention (illustrated above), the generic transformation matrix, :sup:`i-1`\ *T*:sub:`i`, is derived with the following steps:

Substituting in Screw, *S*:

------------------------------------
Task C: Computing Forward Kinematics
------------------------------------

The function ``getFK(self,q)`` gets the forward kinematics, FK, of the robot at any given instance.
It involves multiplying each of the link transformation matrices together to compute the compound transformation matrix.
This is done iteratively in a for loop, beginning line 4. The matrix is updated in line 17.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   def getFK(self,q):

         T_0_i_1 = np.identity(4)
         for i in range(self.nj):

               DH_params = np.copy(self.DH_tab[i,:])
               #print('q',q)
               #print(DH_params)
               if self.joint_types[i] == 'r':
                  DH_params[1] = DH_params[1]+q[i]
               elif self.joint_types[i] == 'p':
                  DH_params[0] = DH_params[0]+q[i]
               
               T_i_1_i = DH_matrix(DH_params) #Pose of joint i wrt i-1
               
               ################################################ TASK 3 (replace np.eye(4) with the correct matrices)
               # np.matmul operation here # #Pose of joint i wrt base

               T_0_i_1 = T_0_i
         T_0_n_1 = T_0_i
         DH_params = np.copy(self.DH_tab[self.nj, :])
         T_n_1_n = DH_matrix(DH_params)
         T_0_n = np.matmul(T_0_n_1, T_n_1_n)

The following equation, definition 2, shows how the pose of the end effector can be calculated with respect to the base frame by multiplying together the transformation matrices of each joint. [1]_

.. image:: img/task_c_eq1.png
   :width: 414
   :alt: Task C equation 1

*Definition 2*

To do this iteratively, premultiply the transformation matrix of the i\ :sup:`th` frame by the matrix of the i-1\ :sup:`th` frame, for each frame. [1]_

.. image:: img/task_c_eq2.png
   :width: 286
   :alt: Task C equation 2

*Definition 3*

The following code implements this equation inside a loop that iterates over each joint.
``np.matmul`` is a numpy function that multiplies two matrices together. ``T_0_i`` is the matrix giving the i\ :sup:`th` joint with respect to the base frame and is updated at each iteration.
``T_0_i_1`` is the matrix from the base frame to the i-1\ :sup:`th` frame, and ``T_i_1_i`` is the matrix from the i-1\ :sup:`th` frame to the i\ :sup:`th` frame.
The code iteratively calls the previous function ``DH_matrix()`` to get the i-1 to i transformation matrix, ``T_i_1_i``.

To implement the above equations in the script, ``[T_0_i] = [T_0_i_1][T_i_1_1]``

==================
Inverse Kinematics
==================

-----------------------------------------------
Task D: Checking if a point is in the workspace
-----------------------------------------------

To convert coordinates from task space to joint space, the geometric inverse kinematics of the robot arm must be calculated.
Figure 3 illustrates the home position of the robot arm.
In the home position, the first link |l0|, is along the |z0| axis of the frame, and the second and third link (|l1|, |l2| respectively) are defined along the |y0| plane, meaning joint angles (|q0|, |q1| and |q2|) are measured relative to this.

Before computing the inverse kinematics of the arm, we must check if a given point is inside its reachable workspace. This is defined by a spherical shell centered on the end of its first link.

.. image:: img/reachable.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: Diagram of reachable space

*Fig 3: Diagram of reachable workspace*. [1]_

Deriving the Reachable Workspace [1]_
-------------------------------------

Using the general equation for a sphere (with *a*, *b*, *c* being the |x|, |y|, |z| coordinates of the centre):

.. image:: img/D_equation1.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: Task D Equation 1

Inequalities can be derived for the outer and inner spheres which bound the workspace, for any point, *P*, in the workspace: 

.. image:: img/D_equation2.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: Task D Equation 2

and

.. image:: img/D_equation3.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: Task D Equation 3

Or in other words, the workspace is a hollow sphere shell with the centre at the origin of *frame 1* (which is at (0,0,\ |l0|) with reference to *frame 0*) , and the radius, *r* according to (\ |l1| - \ |l2|) ≤ *r* ≤ (\ |l1| + \ |l2|).

The following code completes the calculation for the minimum and maximum sphere that defines the reachable workspace, with ``val``, ``r_max`` and ``r_min`` needing to be entered in the following section of code, function ``checkInWS(self, P)``.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

    #Check if point is in WS. returns true or false
    def checkInWS(self, P):
        xP, yP, zP = P
        l0, l1, l2 = self.links
        
        ################################################ TASK 4
        val = 0.
        r_max = 0.
        r_min = 0.

        inWS = True

        if val > r_max**2. or val < r_min**2.:
            inWS = False

        return inWS

The ``r_max`` and ``r_min`` are defined as:

.. image:: img/task_d.png
   :width: 252

*Definition 4* [1]_

Therefore, ``r_max`` and ``r_min`` are defined in the code as shown below and the ``**2`` is removed in the if statement to remove the terms being squared twice.

Task E: Calculating Inverse Kinematics

Inverse kinematics are used to obtain the joint angles required to reach a desired end effector position.
For this, we need equations for ``q0``, ``q1``, ``q2`` in terms of lengths and coordinates.

Task F: Coding Inverse Kinematics
---------------------------------

Using the derivations from **Task E**, the code can be populated with the definitions for ``q``.

Given any feasible point, there may be two configurations to reach it.
These two sets of configurations are stored in 3x1 vectors ``q_a`` and ``q_b``, containing ``qa0``, ``qa1``, ``qa2`` and ``qb0``, ``qb1``, ``qb2`` respectively.

The robot can be treated as a planar two link robot, being rotated about ``z0`` by ``q0``.
Therefore, for any point there is only one ``q0`` value which satisfies the point.
The two configurations are stored together as columns in matrix ``q``.

Original code to complete:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   q_a = np.zeros(3)
   q_b = np.zeros(3)

   q_a[0] = 0.
   q_b[0] = 0.

   r = 0.
   z = 0.

   q_a[2] = 0.
   q_b[2] = 0.

   q_a[1] = 0.
   q_b[1] = 0.
   
   q = [q_a, q_b]

The following code implements the derivation to obtain both IK solutions:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 4-10, 12,13, 15,16, 18, 19, 21

   q_a = np.zeros(3)             # Variables ending in _a represent values for the first possible solution, and _b the second.
   q_b = np.zeros(3)             # Initialise joint angle arrays for the two solutions.

   theta_1 = np.arctan2(yP, xP)  # The following lines compute the variable values for equations 1-11, for both cases.
   r_1 = sqrt(xP**2 + yP**2)
   r_2 = zP - l1
   phi_2 = np.arctan2(r_2, r_1)
   r_3 = sqrt(r_1**2 + r_2**2)
   phi_1 = np.arccos((l3**2 - l2**2 - r_3**2) / (-2 * l2 * r_3))
   phi_3 = np.arccos((r_3**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (-2 * l2 * l3))

   q_a[0] = theta_1              # Theta 1 value from case 1.
   q_b[0] = theta_1              # Value is identical to case 1, as demonstrated in the note above.

   q_a[2] = pi-phi_3             # Theta 3 value from case 1.
   q_b[2] = -pi+phi_3            # Theta 3 value from case 2.

   q_a[1] = phi_2-phi_1          # Theta 2 value from case 1.
   q_b[1] = phi_2+phi_1          # Theta 2 value from case 2.
   
   q = [q_a, q_b]                # Return the calculated joint angles and poses in an array, as required by the function.

.. Note::

   The IK validation uses a ``.csv`` file containing test points, but the originally provided points were found to contain errors, so we tried an additional derivation method and compared the results to make sure our first derivation was in fact producing the correct output.
   
   Source code implementing the additional derivation is shown below.
   This evidence was used to feed back to the tutor team and correct the test points.

   .. code-block:: python
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 4-6, 8, 10,11, 13,14, 16,17, 19

      q_a = np.zeros(3)    # Variables ending in _a represent values for the first possible solution, and _b the second.
      q_b = np.zeros(3)    # Initialise joint angle arrays for the two solutions.

      theta_1 = np.arctan2(yP, xP)     # The following lines compute the variable values required by the alternative derivation.
      r_1 = sqrt(xP**2 + yP**2)
      r_2 = zP - l1
      
      D=(r_1**2+r_2**2-l2**2-l3**2)/(2*l2*l3)
      
      q_a[0] = theta_1       # Theta 1 value from derivation 1.
      q_b[0] = theta_1       # Value is identical to solution 1, as demonstrated in the note above.

      q_a[2] = np.arctan2(sqrt(1-D**2),D)       # Alternative theta 3, case 1 value from another derivation.
      q_b[2] = np.arctan2(-sqrt(1-D**2),D)      # Alternative theta 3, case 2 value from another derivation.
      
      q_a[1] = np.arctan2(r_2,r_1)-np.arctan2(l3*sin(q_a[2]),l2+l3*cos(q_a[2]))     # Alternative theta 2, case 1 value from another derivation.
      q_b[1] = np.arctan2(r_2,r_1)-np.arctan2(l3*sin(q_b[2]),l2+l3*cos(q_b[2]))     # Alternative theta 2, case 2 value from another derivation.
      
      q = [q_a, q_b]    # Return the calculated joint angles and poses in an array, as required by the function.

   Both methods produce the same values, and pass the corrected IK test, so we can successfully validate them.

   For further confirmation that these methods produce the correct output, a simple program was coded than runs a test point through the IK solver, then back through the FK function to validate that the pose is the same as the input.
   
   *Note: We know the FK solver is valid from Task C.
   This was also used as evidence to confirm the error in the initially provided CSV file of test points.*

This allows task space velocity to be calculated from joint space velocities, as shown in the relationship below.

Robot Control

-----------------------------------------------
Task H: Tuning Controller Gains
-----------------------------------------------

The robot arm uses a simple PID controller to reach the desired joint positions.

.. image:: img/pid.png
   :width: 497

*Definition 6: PID controller for torque output* [1]_

PID Controller Explanation
---------------------------------------------------------------

The PID controller being used is broken up into 3 terms; a proportional, derivative and integral term.
PID gains are reactive and make up what is known as ‘feedback’ control [6]_, where the measured output of the system is used to enable better control such that it follows the desired trajectory.
The proportional term on its own is measuring the difference between the achieved joint angle and desired joint angle - this is defined as the error - and then multiplied by a scalar gain value Kp.
It is a measure of ‘system stiffness’ and determines the amount of restoring force needed to overcome simple positional error, with the proportional aspect resulting from the Kp term multiplier.
This will determine how much correction should occur at the output.
The issue with only P being active, is that when Kp is too high, it will result in oscillations of the system that can potentially be destructive given the control system is closed loop [7]_ .
The video below demonstrates this in action for the robotic arm.

    </div

=====

*Video 1: Example of closed loop control when just the proportional term is set.*

Given that the response is based on previous error, the moving average can also cause issues with oscillation.
Using this controller type on its own can also result in a major drawback: offset. This is when there is a sustained error built up over time that cannot be removed by the P term on its own.
The integral term aims to reduce this offset by incrementing or decrementing the controller output and drive the error back to zero, rather than letting it persist.

Let’s consider PI control which brings the output back to a set point, in this case the desired joint angle [8]_.
The integral term in the controller is determining the sum of error over time of the joint angle and multiplying it by the scalar gain Ki.
This is ideal when the system is experiencing static loads and can be seen that when used, has little to no effect in improving a well defined P controller.
This is specific to this simulation scenario as there is no static load.

    </div

=====

*Video 2: Example PI controller*

Finally, the part of the system that will reduce the oscillations and overshoots caused by the P term, the derivative control [9]_ . 
This calculates the velocity of the error, which is the same as the difference between the desired joint velocity and achieved joint velocity.
The purpose of this term is to ‘guess’ where the error is going to go and respond accordingly, i.e. if the error is increasing, D will increment the response so that the increase is prevented, then the PI control will bring this back to the desired set point joint angle.
If the PI control responds too aggressively, the D control will be a brake to the system and subdue the PI response.
This is tuned by the scalar gain Kd.
An example of this can be seen in the video below where a purposefully aggressive PI controller has been selected with clear overshoot and oscillation, and then the difference the derivative term makes in locking the PI response.

.. note::
   If Kp is increased it will minimise the error more quickly and aggressively, which can be useful for handling against external disturbances, however too high and during movements it will overshoot and result in oscillation (a potentially destructive phenomenon for the robotic arm.) 
   Kd is used to prevent this and act as a ‘brake’ to the system, but too much of this and the robot will struggle to reach its desired location, so it must be increased with caution.

Implementation

To implement this in ROS we must load up the simulation environment, Gazebo, using the command ``rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo`` - ensure that ``roscore`` is already running. 
The robot arm can then be loaded into the world by using:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   cd Desktop/DE3Robotics
   source devel/setup.bash
   roslaunch coursework_1 coursework_1.launch

The PID values are edited in the ``controller_settings.yaml`` file. 
Any changes must first be saved, then the previous robotic arm must be terminated in its terminal window using ``Ctrl + C``. 
The previous robotic arm can be deleted from gazebo by using the ``delete`` key. 
Then simply repeat the process for loading in a new arm.

To edit the PID values for each controller, the highlighted lines should be changed. 
By default the i value is clamped at 0. 
To change this, two more variables should be added, ``i_clamp_max`` and ``i_clamp_min``. 
Setting these allows the upper and lower bounds of i to be changed freely. 
To begin with, all values are set to 0.

      joint: joint_2

To test the robotic arm the following lines should be run. 
To run the robot with updated PID values, follow the above method and run the ``kinematics.py full`` code again.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   cd Desktop/DE3Robotics/src/coursework_1/src 
   python3 kinematics.py full

This runs the ``full`` command which is use to call the function ``sendCommands()`` which communicates with Gazebo using a ``.publish()`` method. 
It communicates at a frequency of 100 Hz, where the ``kinematics.py`` file is sending interpolated joint values between its current position and desired position to allow it to move smoothly and simulate actual movement, rather than directly sending the final joint value which would not work.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   def sendCommands(self,q):

         #print("SENDING JOINT VALUES ", q)
         rate = rospy.Rate(100) #Hz
         for i in range(3):

               n_conn = 0
               while not n_conn:
                  self.ROSPublishers[i].publish(q[i])
                  n_conn = self.ROSPublishers[i].get_num_connections()
                  rate.sleep()

To effectively tune the gains of the robotic arm such that it follows the trajectory with minimal error, the error graph for joint angles can be used. 
This can be accessed by using the ``rqt`` command in the terminal and then selecting *Plugins* → *Visualization* → *Plot*, then typing ``/DES3R/joint_0_position_controller/state/error``. 
Then repeating this for each ``joint_1_position_controller`` and ``joint_2_position_controller``.

There are a number of methods that can be used to tune the controller, with a common and simple heuristic-based method being Ziegler-Nichols [10]_.
This can be done by measuring the step-response of the system and first finding ``Kp``, then using that to find ``Kd`` and ``Ki``.
Alternatively, for the purpose of this report, it can be done through trial and error, visually determining results.
It is performed similarly to the order of explanation in this report.
The steps used are summarised below.

1. Set all gains to zero
2. Increase Kp until the controller output oscillates at a constant rate. It should continue to be increased such that the response should increase more quickly without the system becoming unstable.
3. Once Kp response is fast enough, Ki is now increased with small steps to ensure the effects are seen. The goal of increasing Ki is to reduce the steady state errors. If there are no steady state errors and primarily overshoot and oscillation, you can skip to tuning Kd.
4. With Kp and Ki set with minimal steady state error and consistent oscillation, Kd can be used for dampening effects. Increasing Kd will decrease overshoot of the system. The ramp rate should be monitored to ensure that Kd is not tuned too high, such that the desired trajectory is still achieved. Increase this till the system is stable and overshoot and oscillation is minimised. System tuning complete.

.. warning::

   If Kd is set too high, then the output of the PI controller will be against the D term as they are both trying to achieve opposite effects. 
   Therefore, D should be increased cautiously. 
   The video below demonstrates this.

*Example of Kd set too high*



The table below summarises the process and outputs seen. 
For further insight, please view the embedded simulation video that demonstrates each output.

Due to computing limits, the identical PID values will be processed for each joint controller initially during the test methods. 
Following this, hyper-parameter tuning can then be considered to optimise the result for each joint controller if required.

*Task H PID Results Table*

There was no obvious reason to individually tune joints so the values for all controllers could be kept the same for simplicity sake in control - this may not be the case for where the load is increased on specific joints.
The table below helps to summarise the effects of increasing the PID parameters, and ultimately helped feed into the tuning process when visually determining the next iteration needed to improve the control.

.. image:: img/TuningTable.png
   :width: 700

*PID Tuning Table* [11]_

After visually understanding the output of the PID controller it was found that proportional gain was increased till there was steady state oscillation.
Once the proportional gain was sufficient, the derivative gain was increased till it removed the oscillation and overshoot, but stopping at the point where it prevents P from reaching the desired end state.
P was then incremented again to see if it made a positive difference to the rise time.
Given this was the case, D was again incremented until the error was minimised.
No steady-state error was identified, therefore no integral gain was required.

Point 3 of the simulation was outside the workspace so it provides a large positional error shown in the code, which is expected, but this also means that no joint angles are sent to the robotic arm.
This means that in the gazebo simulation, the positional error is not affected as the robotic arm assumes the same pose as the last command it was sent.

.. note::
   Quick Tuning Guide [12]_ :

   - Use Kp to decrease rise time (increases oscillation and system instability)
   - Use Kd to reduce overshoot and settling time (too high is bad for noise when in a real-world environment)
   - Use Ki to eliminate steady state error. (but adds to overshoot)

During the live simulation session, it was found that hyper tuning was not needed as the end effector mass was 0.01kg, and all controllers could easily be set to the same value, thus streamlining the process and keeping control simple. 
In later tasks, this was not the case and the effects of individual joint tuning was explored.

The final results demonstrate excellent control of the robotic arm with minimal error. 
To improve the final values, the P term and D term could both be set even higher.
However in a real world scenario this may not be desirable as too much D can make the system highly sensitive to noise [13]_ and potentially cause instability, this is why the chosen values are appropriate for effective control of the robotic arm.

Task I: Adapting the Robot Arm
------------------------------
This task requires the user to edit the parameters of the robotic arm, in this case the mass of the end effector. 
The mass of the end effector is modified from 0.01kg to 30kg. 
The file to edit is the robot_model_gazebo.xacro which is located in the file path ``/Desktop/DE3Robotics/src/coursework_1/urdf``.
The ``ee_mass`` variable contains this information on line 16 as highlighted. Change this from 0.01kg to 30kg as shown below.

Results
-------

Running the previous PID controller values with this new end effector mass shows that the gain values are not high enough to drive the links. 
This is due to the additional force exerted on the joints by the mass which requires an increased set of gains.
The only joint able to move is joint 0 when rotating about the base. 
This suggests that each joint could be tuned differently, with joint 1 and 2 requiring more gain to lift the increased end effector mass up against the effect of gravity, whereas joint 0 does not have to do this. 
The increased gains will likely be significantly higher than the previous robotic arm. The next section focuses on repeating the PID tuning process.

Using the same method as described in Task H, the PID values were updated to account for the increased end effector mass. 
The initial starting values used are based on the previous values obtained.

*Task J PID Results Table* [14]_   

Hyper tuning was explored for joints 1 and 2 as the load acting on them increased due to the increased mass of the end effector. 
This is highligted well in the video.
A value of 5000 was applied to joint 2, whilst joint 1 and joint 0 were kept at 3500. 
It clearly benefited the robotic arm doing this, as it reduced the 'droop' experienced by the final link, however to keep further tuning simple, values were made identical again for further iterations.

It was found that utilizing I to reduce steady state error was not necessary in this case given that it added to the overshoot in the system.
The tradeoff between the reduced steady-state error was not worth the significantly higher added overshoot.
This caused an exploration of a range of PID values, ultimately returning to the original pairing that was found to be effective, demonstrating a relatively robust method with parameters that allow for effective control of the robotic arm.
