==========================================================
Welcome to DE3 Robotics Group 1 Coursework 2 Documentation
==========================================================

We (Shafae Ali, Oscar Jones, Oscar Leclercq, Oliver Veal) have decided to create a readthedocs page for our coursework submissions instead of a Google Drive or Word document. This way this documentation can be used for teaching ROS at any point in the future, as well as have integrated code blocks and interactive videos.
For the purpose of archiving the document, we will be submitting in PDF and HTML formats.

.. warning::

    For a more interactive experience, please use the web_ version instead of the PDF. Thanks!

C-Space Map
==================

-------------------------------
Task A: C-Space Dilation
-------------------------------

This task initialises the Denavit-Hartenberg, D-H, table.
The table contains all the necessary information to orientate each link of the robot in a consistent manner so that the position of each link can be found relative to the other.
As the robot moves, the D-H table is updated.
The D-H table is a convenient way to store this information as the transformation matrix for each link can be evaluated using the corresponding row in the table.

Part i - Square Mask
----------------------------

To make the D-H table, the reference


Part ii - Circular Mask
----------------------------

To make the D-H table, the reference

Task B: Adding Waypoints by Hand
--------------------------------

This task initialises the Denavit-Hartenberg, D-H, table.
The table contains all the necessary information to orientate each link of the robot in a consistent manner so that the position of each link can be found relative to the other.
As the robot moves, the D-H table is updated.
The D-H table is a convenient way to store this information as the transformation matrix for each link can be evaluated using the corresponding row in the table.
